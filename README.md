# OgameX Automation Project 
### This is a project developed mostly in Python to automate the game called OgameX which is a browser real time game.

### Right now is only working under Linux because it has some libraries that I haven't found in Windows.

## Features:

1. ## Expedition BOT
2. ## Coordinates finder
3. ## Asteroids finder
4. ## Activity maker BOT
5. ## Spy BOT
6. ## Inactive farmer BOT


If need help to make the features work, let me know and I will be glad to help.
